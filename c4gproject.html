                    Overall, users navigated through the website without difficulty. 100% of users referred to the tasks as either simple or easy. Confusion most often stemmed from issues choosing filters for uncommon products or technical issues with the InVision app. More
                    usability tests will have to be conducted on other site features such as the reviews section placement and the grocery list feature once itâ€™s complete.

                    While the feedback was mostly positive from participants, the prototype is far from perfect. I plan on fleshing out the rest of the pages of the prototype, especially for mobile bookings. I plan to continue the iterative cycle of testing and updating
                    the prototype. I will use Zeplin to hand off the design to the developer team when I have made all improvements to the prototype.
